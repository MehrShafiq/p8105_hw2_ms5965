## Problem 1

Defining a path to the dataset.

``` r
path_to_data = "./data/trash_wheel_data.xlsx"
```

Reading Mr Trashwheel Data.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
    read_xlsx(
        path = path_to_data,
        sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
        range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
    mutate(
        sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
        sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

Reading and cleaning precipitation data for 2017 & 2018

``` r
prec_17 = 
  read_excel(
    path = path_to_data,
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1) %>% 
  
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate (year)

prec_18 = 
  read_excel(
    path = path_to_data,
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1) %>% 
  
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate (year)
```

Combining 2017 & 2018 Precipitation Datasets

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(
        month = 1:12,
        month_name = month.name)

prec_17_18 = bind_rows(prec_17, prec_18) 

prec_17_18 = left_join(prec_17_18, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 observations in our
final dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data.
The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8. The
total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

Defining a path to the dataset, then cleaning it..

``` r
path_to_NYC_data = read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_subway_data.csv") %>% 
janitor::clean_names() 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
subset_NYC_data = path_to_NYC_data %>% 
  
  select(line, entrance_latitude, entrance_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada, station_name, exit_only) %>% 
  
mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)) 
```

This dataset contains information on the NYC Transit - with respect to
their entrance, exit, routes, lines and ADA compliance for each subway
in the city.

The unadulterated dataset was cleaned in the following steps: \* A
subset of the dataset with only relevant variables was created. \* The
‘entry’ variable which had YES & NO values was converted into a
logical variables where YES -\> TRUE and NO -\> FALSE.

This data has 20 variables and 1868 observations.

This dataset is not tidy.

#### Problem 2: Questions

##### Part A:

``` r
distinct_stations = distinct(subset_NYC_data, line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(station_name, line)
```

There are 465 distinct stations by name and line in NYC.

##### Part B:

``` r
ADA_compliant = filter(subset_NYC_data, ada == TRUE)
```

468 stations are ADA compliant.

##### Part C:

``` r
vendor_data = filter(subset_NYC_data, vending == "YES") %>% 
  count(entry)

vendor_data 
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 2
    ##   entry     n
    ##   <lgl> <int>
    ## 1 FALSE     1
    ## 2 TRUE   1684

1684 out of 1685 stations with vending allow entrance.

#### Tidying the dataframe

``` r
tidy_data = mutate_at(subset_NYC_data, vars(route1:route11), as.character) %>%

pivot_longer(
    route1:route11, 
    names_to = "route_name",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_number") %>% 
drop_na(route_number)
```

  - The multiple route names (route1 to route11) were all converted in
    the same type of variable, that is, character variable.
  - The originally wide dataframe was changed into a long table where
    the umbrella variable “route\_name” stores all the route numbers.

This dataframe is tidy now.

##### A train

``` r
A_train = filter(tidy_data, route_number == "A") 

A_stations = distinct(A_train, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE)

A_ADA = filter(A_stations, ada == TRUE)
```

There are 56 distinct stations serving the A train. Of these stations,
15 are ADA compliant.
